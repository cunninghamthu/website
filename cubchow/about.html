        <p class="p-column-1">My name is Teresa Cunningham. I am currently changing my status-quo, getting out of my confort zone, and looking forward to meet the me I always wanted to be. Although I studied computer science in college and received my bachelors at Sacramento State, I never felt that I was good enough to get an actual job in programming and that there was always going to be someone better than me. So I continued to learn and grow my knowledge in computer science.</p>
        <p class="p-column-2">The only way I will get better is if make coding a part of my routine. This will become my new habbit and I look forward to becoming an amazing programmer. This website will showcase my progress, achievements, and plans. Once I found out that I was scared of change, I quickly looked for ways to re-wire my brain, just like how one would re-wire a computer that wasn't working. Now is the time for change, one program at a time.</p>
